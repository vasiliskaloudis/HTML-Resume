# HTML-Resume
An analytical resume of my  so far working and studying career written in HTML only! 
The basic idea is to create a step by step Resume beginning with HTML, then update it with CSS and a third version with JavaScript. 

The main bullet points are that all the hyperlinks are targeted to blank pages, that means every single hypelink leads to a new tag. Only pages of my creation are connected in the same tag.
